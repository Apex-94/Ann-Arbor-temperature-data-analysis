# Ann-Arbor-temperature-data-analysis
Analyzing the temperature data of Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States for a period of 10 years(2004-2014) and than comparing it with 2015 data to see how temperature broke all records in 2015. All the visualizations are done using matplotlib

Dataset details:
This data comes from a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Daily Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Daily). The GHCN-Daily is comprised of daily climate records from thousands of land surface stations across the globe.
Each row in the datafile corresponds to a single observation.

column variables: 
id : station identification code 
date : date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g. 2012-01-24 = January 24, 2012)
element : indicator of element type 
TMAX : Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C) 
TMIN : Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C) 
value : data value for element (tenths of degrees C)

The final visualisation consists of line graph of the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014.Overlaid by a scatter of the 2015 data for any points (highs and lows) for which the ten year record (2005-2014) record high or record low was broken in 2015

This project was made by me as a week 2 assignment for "applied plotting and charting" course on coursera under the data science specialization program offered by University of Michigan on coursera.
